7-5. Movie Tickets: A movie theater charges different ticket prices depending on
a personâ€™s age. If a person is under the age of 3, the ticket is free; if they are
between 3 and 12, the ticket is $10; and if they are over age 12, the ticket is
$15. Write a loop in which you ask users their age, and then tell them the cost
of their movie ticket.
