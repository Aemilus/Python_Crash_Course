    I would like to thank the author for this wonderful Python book.
Each concept related to Python has been presented with simplicity, and it
feels so natural to study.
    These Python exercises are well-chosen and
are meant to make you apply what you learned so far,
but it also makes you put a bit of your imagination
- thus making the implementation with Python to have a personal Python touch.
