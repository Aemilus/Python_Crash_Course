14-1. Press P to Play: Because Alien Invasion uses keyboard input to control the
ship, itâ€™s best to start the game with a keypress. Add code that lets the player
press P to start. It may help to move some code from check_play_button() to a
start_game() function that can be called from both check_play_button() and
check_keydown_events().
