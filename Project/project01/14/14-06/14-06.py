14-6. Expanding Alien Invasion: Think of a way to expand Alien Invasion. For
example, you could program the aliens to shoot bullets down at the ship or
add shields for your ship to hide behind, which can be destroyed by bullets
from either side. Or use something like the pygame.mixer module to add sound
effects like explosions and shooting sounds.
