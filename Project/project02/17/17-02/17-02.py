17-2. Active Discussions: Using the data from hn_submissions.py, make a bar
chart showing the most active discussions currently happening on Hacker
News. The height of each bar should correspond to the number of comments
each submission has. The label for each bar should include the submissionâ€™s
title and should act as a link to the discussion page for that submission.
